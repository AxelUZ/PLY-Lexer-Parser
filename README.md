# PLY-Lexer-Parser

## Description

This project implements a lexical and syntactic analyzer (lexer and parser) using PLY (Python Lex-Yacc). PLY is an implementation of lex and yacc in Python, which facilitates the analysis and interpretation of specific languages. This project is ideal for understanding how to build analyzers for specific programming or markup languages.

## Features

- **Lexer**: Built using the `lex` functionality in PLY to tokenize text inputs.
- **Parser**: Uses `yacc` from PLY to analyze lexical structures and generate a parse tree.

## Installation

To use this project, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install PLY using pip:

```bash
pip install ply
```

## Documentation
For more details on how PLY works and how you can extend or modify this project, see the [official PLY documentation](https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ply.html).
